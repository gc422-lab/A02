Step 1: On your browser search webstorm download. 
Step 2: Click on the jetbrains website.
Step 3: Create an account

Step 5: Install webstorm
Step 6: Click on create a project
Step 7: Create a git and github account
Step 8: On webstorm go to the tab on the top and click on git
Step 9: Look for the part that says github and then click on share project on github

Step 6: Connect git account to github


If you do this you will have webstrom install, a github account, and your project file should be connected to github.

Part. 2:
Branch: A branch allows the user to add or fix any bugs in their code without affecting the whole repository. 

Clone: This creates a local copy of the repository file that you sent to github. This allows you to save information and to make changes to individual files

Commit: This is a file that saves the changes that you have made. For example if you change a part of your code the commit file will save it.

Fetch: It keeps your loac files up to date with remote files

Git: Git is a platform that saves and tracks changes made to files

Github: A cloud platform that allows you to add and save files into a server. Not only can you save your files but you can share them with other users and vice versa

Merge: WHat this command does is that it moves the changes from one branch and it applies it to the other

Merge conflict: This conflict tends to happen because there is a conflict between the commit files. In order to solve this problem you must manually change the files that are conflicting. 

Push: The git push command transfers your local files from your machines into github, more specifically the remote repository. This allows for you to publish your code and to share it with others.

Pull: The gitpush common is a command that allows you to merge changes from one to another

Remote: It is a git repository that allows you to share information with others and for them to make changes

Repository: A repository is where you can save all your code or store some type of information.
